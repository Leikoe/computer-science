# computer-science
A curated list of the very best computer science materials I found while wandering online.  
The works featured here I either have read / watched or are on my list.
If something is here but I haven't read it yet, It means that I think it will be extremely high quality and worthwhile even though I haven't read it yet.

## Maths
### General
- Grant Sanderson's absolute masterpiece of a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown). Go there first if you are searching for animated math videos.
### Game development
- Freya Holmér's insanely well crafted [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@acegikmo). You can find a series about Splines, game dev maths basics and much more.
### Machine Learning
- Adam Dhalla's excellent [The Complete Mathematics of Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixl3nykKG9M) video (the rest of his channel also has a very complete linear algebra class).
### Category Theory
- Bartosz Milewski's [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DrBartosz) (yes, the whole channel).

## Machine Learning - Architectures
- Andrej Karpathy's amazing [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AndrejKarpathy) I don't think there is the need to present it but in case: he takes you from ngram model to transformer, also teaches about how to make a tiny backprop engine and much more !!

## Optimization
### Machine Learning oriented / random hacking
- Geohot's archive [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@geohotarchive) where his stream vods get uploaded (all the tinygrad streams are gold but you can also find quality rants about AMD).
- The excellent [How to Optimize a CUDA Matmul Kernel for cuBLAS-like Performance: a Worklog](https://siboehm.com/articles/22/CUDA-MMM) blog post by SIBOEHM
- The much more recent [Beating cuBLAS in Single-Precision General Matrix Multiplication](https://salykova.github.io/sgemm-gpu) blog post by Aman Salykov. **I HAVENT READ YET**
### HFT / MM firms related
- Carl Cook's very fun & entertaining [CppCon 2017 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH1Tta7purM)
### Game dev
- Nemean's insanely well made video on [Fast Inverse Square Root — A Quake III Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/@Nemean).

## Languages - Rust
- Jon Gjengset's incredible [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@jonhoo)
- No Boilerplate's fast technical videos, on his (youtube channel)[https://www.youtube.com/@NoBoilerplate]
---

## Data structures
- junminlee's [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@JamieGo-id9xu) (this one seems new, maybe she deleted the old one?)
---

## Misc how X works (low level, linux / OS dev)
- sphaerophoria's gold mine of a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@sphaerophoria). He takes you to building your own google maps, making your own os and even writing your own gpu driver.
